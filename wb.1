.SH NAME
wb \- A wallbase.cc image search tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wb
[OPTIONS]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wb
is a tool that searches wallbase.cc for images according to the user-specified
options and then prints their URLs. wb can be combined with other tools like
.BR curl (1)
or
.BR wget (1)
to download the images.

wb supports almost all of the image search features present in wallbase.cc:
all of the filters (including search by dominating color), toplist, random
images, image sorting, etc.

.I NSFW
images require a wallbase.cc login. This is required by wallbase.cc and cannot
be overcome on the client side.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "-a, --aspect <aspect ratio>"
Search for images with this exact aspect ratio. Aspect ratio must have the
format: <number>:<number>, for example: 16:9. By default searches for images
with any aspect ratio.

.IP "-A, --anime, --manga"
Search for images in the
.B "Manga / Anime"
board. This option can be combined with
.I "-G, --general"
and
.I "-H, --high-res"
options. By default searches for images in all of the boards.

.IP "-c, --color <color>"
Search for images with a dominating color similar to the specified color. The
color must be a 6 character length hexadecimal number, with an optional '0x'
prefix. Examples: 75a045, 0xAF7643.

.IP "-G, --general"
Search for images in the
.B "Wallpapers / General"
board. This option can be combined with
.I "-A, --anime, --manga"
and
.I "-H, --high-res"
options. By default searches for images in all of the boards.

.IP "-H, --high-res"
Search for images in the
.B "High Resolution"
board. This option can be combined with
.I "-A, --anime, --manga"
and
.I "-G, --general"
options. By default searches for images in all of the boards.

.IP "-K, --sketchy"
Search for images with the
.B Sketchy
purity. This option can be combined with
.I "-S, --sfw"
and
.I "-N, --nsfw"
options. By default searches only for images with the
.B SFW
purity when NOT logged in and all purities when logged in.

.IP "-n, --images <count>"
Get the specified number of image URLs. <count> must a number higher than 0. The
number of printed URLs will sometimes be less than the specified number, but
only if the number of images found is less than <count>. Defaults to
.B 20

.IP "-N, --nsfw"
Search for images with the
.B NSFW
purity. This option can be combined with
.I "-S, --sfw"
and
.I "-K, --sketchy"
options. By default searches only for images with the
.B SFW
purity when NOT logged in and all purities when logged in.

.IP "-o, --collection <collection>"
Get images from the specified collection. <collection> is the id of the
collection. This id can be seen in the collection url. For example:
http://wallbase.cc/collection/\fB33521\fP. The id is in bold here.

.IP "-p, --password <password>"
Specify the wallbase.cc password. This and
.I "-u, --username"
are required to login to wallbase.cc when searching for images with the
.B NSFW
purity.

.IP "-P, --show-progress"
Show the progress of parsing image URLs from wallbase.cc. This is disabled by
default, because it messes up the output if used with other tools.

Example of the progress information:
 Getting page URLs: 1 - 20
 Getting image URLs: 20 / 20
 http://image.url/here.png

.IP "-q, --query <string>"
Search for images related to the specified string.
The string can include expressions documented in
.I http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/2.1.1/extended-syntax.html

This is ignored when either
.I "-R, --random"
or
.I "-t, --toplist"
options are specified.

.IP "-r, --resolution <resolution>"
Search for images with exactly the specified or greater resolutions. The
resolution can be specified in these formats:
.RS
.IP <xres>x<yres>
In this case the program searches for images with an equal or greater
resolution. Example: 1920x1080
.IP =<xres>x<yres>
In this case the program search for images with the exact resolution. Example:
=800x600

Set the image sort order. <sort> can be any of the following:

 r, relevance
 v, views
 d, date (default)
 f, favorites
 n, random

<sort> can prefixed with a '+' or a '-'. '+' changes the sort order to ascending
and '-' changes the sort order to descending. By default descending sort order
is used.

.IP "views"
Sorts by number of views, descending (images with the most number of views
first)
